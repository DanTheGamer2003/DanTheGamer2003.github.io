I"@<p>Hello! Since I had some free time on my hands, I decided to go ahead set up a very basic blog for my website. I don’t know how frequently I will post here, but I figure it’s good to have set up if I ever need it for whatever reason. Plus, sometimes it good to have a place to spew your stupid ideas and rant.</p>
